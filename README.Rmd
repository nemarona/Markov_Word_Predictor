This is the GitHub repository for the Capstone Project in the
[Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)
at Coursera.

The goal of the Capstone Project is to build a predictive model,
and a concomitant [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) app,
for the next word that a user might type on, e.g., a smartphone keyboard.
To this end, we were provided with a large corpus of text, consisting of
three files with excerpts from blogs, news, and Twitter.

My $n$-th order Markov chain model:
$$X_{t} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \lambda_{k} X_{t-k} Q_{k}.$$

To compute the $\lambda$-coefficients, solve the following
linear programming problem:
$$\min_{\lambda} \left\lVert \sum_{k=1}^{n} \lambda_{k} \hat{X} Q_{k} - \hat{X} \right\rVert,$$
where $\hat{X}$ is the stationary distribution.
